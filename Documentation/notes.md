# Coding Challenge Notes

From Stephen

1. Takes inputs for a one way flight (Departure time, from airport code, to airport code, flight number). E.x. 2018-12-30T11:11, JFK to YVR, WS123 (note this is not a real westjet flight, youâ€™ll need to get a real one)
2. Retrieve the seats and prices from www.westjet.com for that specific 1 way flight's seatmap.
3. Print out all of the seats on the plane, indicate whether they are available and if available what is the price.

## Breaking the Problem Down

**Input**

- Need to use text input to get
  - departure time (2018-12-30T11:11)
    - What time format is this?
  - from airport code (JFK)
  - to airport code (YVR)
  - flight number (WS123)

**API**

- Need to use WestJet's API
- only a 1 way flight

**UPDATE:** No WestJet API - need to use web scraping API, maybe BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Nightwatch.js?

**Webscraping**

- WestJet's search URLs don't contain the airport codes, and rely on cookies/sessions to maintain information. This means that we can't construct a URL from the input and then scrape the HTML returned.
- BeautifulSoup doesn't let us manipulate a page, only read data from it. We need to be able to programmatically search for a particular flight.
- Nightwatch lets us do that. We'll need to write (at minimum) a portion of the code in Javascript to manipulate the website.
- Might want to use Python and BeautifulSoup to read the data afterwards,
